<center font="30px">Project: "Amakuru-kin"</center>

Create a basic application that manages and displays user information using key concepts like input/output, conditions, loops, and functions.

# Features to Implement

    User Registration

Accept user details (e.g., name, age, location).
Validate inputs (e.g., age should be a number).
Store information in an object or list.
Menu System

Provide options (e.g., "Add User," "View Users," "Exit").

Handle invalid inputs gracefully.

    Data Manipulation

Allow adding, updating, or deleting user information.

    Custom Functions

Create reusable functions like ongeraUmuntu() (add a user) or tangaUrutonde() (list users).

# Advanced Options (Optional)

Integrate date and time for logging actions using the KIN_IGIHE module.
Export user data to a simple text file (if file handling is part of the language).

# Why This Project?

✅Learn Core Syntax: Reinforces foundational concepts in the language.
✅Practical: Builds a real-world system to organize information.
✅Scalable: Can add features like file exports or integrations with other modules in the future.

# Happy codding with Kin lang!!
