# Amakuru kin project

This project implements a basic application that manages and displays user information leveraging [Kin lang](https://github.com/kin-lang) features like input/output, conditions, loops, and functions.

Features Implemented

1. User Registration

Accept user details (e.g., name, age, location).

Validate inputs (e.g., age is checked to ensure it is a number).

Store user information in a structured object or list.

2. Menu System

Provide a simple interactive menu with options like:

"Add User"

"View Users"

"Exit"

Handle invalid inputs gracefully to ensure a smooth user experience.

3. Data Manipulation

Add new user details dynamically.

View the list of registered users with their details.

4. Custom Functions

Reusable functions for core operations such as:

ongeraUmuntu() for adding a user.

tangaUrutonde() for listing users.

Advanced Features

1. Date and Time Integration

Use the KIN_IGIHE module to log actions with real-time timestamps.

2. Data Export (Optional)

Export user data to a simple text file for persistent storage.
